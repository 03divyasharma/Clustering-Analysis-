## Introduction 
As a part of the extensive market segmentation analysis that my team and I carried out at Feynn Labs, we implemented our first forray into market segmentaion strategies in this project, focused on segmenting customers into different categories using unsupervised machine learning algorithms in Python. 

## Market Segmentation Analysis
Market segmentation is one of the key building blocks of strategic marketing. Market segmentation is essential
for marketing success: the most successful firms drive their businesses based on segmentation.[1]

## Problem Statement

##### This is a study task for all teams to have thorough research profiency in market segmentation analysis. 

We were required to demostrate our undertsanding by implementing cluster analysis. 

## Procedure
We were provided with the McDonald's case study dataset and cluster analysis code in R as reference. We compiled our results togethers in a report. 


## Algorithms Used

* Heirarchical Clustering : Hierarchical clustering (also called hierarchical cluster analysis or HCA) is a method of cluster analysis that seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters. The results of hierarchical clustering[1] are usually presented in a dendrogram.
* Kmean Clustering : It aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), serving as a prototype of the cluster.
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Principal component analysis is a linear dimensionality reduction technique with applications in exploratory data analysis, visualization and data preprocessing.

These algorithms have helped us explore clusters of products and consumer categories.
